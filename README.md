# Connection API QLT

## Overview
Connection API QLT (Quality, Load, and Throughput) is a RESTful API designed to provide insights into the quality, load, and throughput of network connections. It offers a set of endpoints to query and analyze various metrics related to network connections, aiding in monitoring and optimizing network performance.

## Features
- **Quality Monitoring**: Assess the quality of network connections based on metrics such as latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- **Load Analysis**: Analyze the load on network connections, including bandwidth usage and congestion levels.
- **Throughput Evaluation**: Measure the throughput of connections to ensure optimal data transfer rates.
- **RESTful API**: Utilizes REST architecture for easy integration and usage.
- **Scalable**: Built to handle large-scale networks and high volumes of requests.
- **Secure**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and integrity.
